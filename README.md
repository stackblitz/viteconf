This is the main development repository for the ViteConf 2022 online conference website powering [viteconf.org](https://viteconf.org). This website is built using Nuxt 3 and is a fullstack application. It leverages server-side rendering, backend database interactions for registration, and of course is powered by Vite under the hood using [Nuxt 3](https://v3.nuxtjs.org/).
